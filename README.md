Piscine Stage â€“ 01 Talent Academy

This repository contains my projects, exercises, and learning progress from the Piscine stage at 01 Talent Academy.
The Piscine is an intensive, hands-on coding bootcamp designed to build strong problem-solving skills, teamwork, and a deep understanding of programming fundamentals.

During this stage, I worked on:

* Writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code.

* Solving algorithmic challenges with a focus on logic and efficiency.

* Collaborating with peers to complete group projects.

* Strengthening my understanding of C programming, Git, and shell commands.

This repo reflects my journey of growth, resilience, and continuous learning throughout the Piscine experience.
